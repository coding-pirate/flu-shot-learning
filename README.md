# flu-shot-learning

We are given a data set containing the responses of thousands of people to various survey questions. 
Using ML (machine learning), we need to predict whether each person in the survey:
(1) received or did not receive the H1N1 vaccine
(2) received or did not receive the Seasonal vaccine
