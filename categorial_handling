Ratio data (household_adult,household_children) is perfect the way it is.  No changes necessary.
Ordinal data (exceptage_group,education,income_poverty) is perfect the way it is.  No changes necessary.

Ordinal data like age_group[18-34, 35-44, 45-54, 55-64, 65+], education[<12 Years, 12 Years, CollegeGraduate,  Some  College],
income_poverty[â‰¤$75,000m. Above  poverty  but  below $75,000. Above$75,000] needs to be converted into regular numbers (0,1,2,3,...).

Nominal data needs to be converted into regular numbers (0,1,2,3,...), and then one-hot encoded

Binary variables like sex [Male Female], marital_status [Married, Not Married] 
andrent_or_own[Own, Rent] need to be converted into regular numbers (0,1).  
Do binary variables need to be one-hot encoded?
